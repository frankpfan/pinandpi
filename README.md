# PynAndPi

A project (if it can be) I wrote that simulates Buffon's needle-dropping experiment.

Changes won't come frequently, and maybe never will there be any commits.

Fun facts:

* As a Chinese student, I had to speak 'Chinglish' when coding.
  So I used 'throw' a needle instead of 'drop' it...
